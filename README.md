# Cardinal

[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/803361) // [View documentation](http://cbracco.github.io/Cardinal/)

Cardinal is a small, “[mobile first](http://cbrac.co/116bQqk)” CSS framework with some useful default styles, scalable typography, reusable modules, and a simple responsive grid system.

## What does that mean?

This framework is for building responsive web applications. It’s not meant to be simply “bolted on” to a project like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Zurb’s Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com); it’s a starting point that you will want to customize and build upon to suit your application or project.

Cardinal provides a new approach to scaling web typography and layout across multiple devices. It places **little emphasis on pixel-precision**, but does not restrict its usage. Instead, Cardinal leverages the power of the `rem` unit to make it simpler to scale the type and layout of **the entire application** for different devices.

## Who should use this?

Designers and developers who want to build well-organized, responsive web applications *without losing their minds* should use Cardinal.

The purpose of this framework is to make it easier to rapidly prototype, build, scale, and maintain CSS for responsive web applications. Cardinal omits many aesthetic design decisions often bog down larger, more complicated CSS frameworks, leaving the design and creativity up to you.
