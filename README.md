========

A barebones collection of killer front-end code for starting web projects.

**Beware:** this is a work in progress. It's pre-alpha nonsense, but feel free to help out!

## To do

- Forms styling
- Less emphasis on baseline grid
- Separate the demo from this repo, create a one-page site for it
- Use new Modernizr build (w/ REM detection) to load the REM fallback conditionally
