Cardinal
========

A barebones collection of killer front-end code for starting web projects.

**Beware:** this is a work in progress. It's pre-alpha nonsense, but feel free to help out!

## To do

- Forms styling
- Fancy up the baseline grid tool
- Spruce up buttons
- Separate the demo from this repo, create a one-page site for it (possible help [here](http://lea.verou.me/2011/10/easily-keep-gh-pages-in-sync-with-master/))
- Use new Modernizr build (w/ REM detection) to load the REM fallback conditionally
- Clean up main.css comments (use numerical references)
